This project contains a [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) application providing an [mqtt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) service used to connect node contexts together using connection profiles. The application works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, linux, macOS, and Windows WSL.
